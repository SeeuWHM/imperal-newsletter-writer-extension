"""Tiny shared nav-state doc — which project/newsletter/view is currently open.

Written by panels_workspace.py on every render (so the center panel survives
a plain reload with no kwargs) and read by panels_side.py too, so the
sidebar knows which project is "open" right now without the two panels
needing any direct reference to each other. Holds only IDs/view name, never
newsletter content. Mirrors imperal-article-writer-extension/navstate.py.
